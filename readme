Required software:
	WorldEdit for Minecraft
	NeoForge for Minecraft (WorldEdit dependency)
	Archive utility capable of gzip (7Zip will handle this on Windows)
	DFHack

Setup:
	1. Ensure Minecraft (Java Edition) is installed. Launch it at least once to be sure.
	2. Install Neoforge
		- Download and run installer from https://neoforged.net/
	3. Install WorldEdit
		- Obtain latest package from https://modrinth.com/plugin/worldedit/versions?l=neoforge
		- Place the package in <your Minecraft install>/mods
		- The install is normally at: C:\<your user name>\AppData\Roaming\.Minecraft
	4. Install compression utility
		- 7Zip is suggested for Windows and can be obtained from https://7-zip.org/download.html
	5. Install DFHack
		- For Steam installations, DFHack can be found as a Steam application. Ensure it installs
		  to the same drive as Dwarf Fortress and no further action should be required.
		- For classic installations, download DFHack from https://github.com/dfhack/dfhack/releases
		  and unpack to your Dwarf Fortress install folder.
	6. Load the export scripts into DFHack
		- Get the script files from https://github.com/RocketTaco/dfhack-export
		- Place the script files in <your DF install>\hack\scripts\export


Exporting to Minecraft:
	1. Open the DFHack console
	
	2. Enter the following command:
		export/export [AREA] --format mc --file <filename>
		
		AREA is an optional field limiting the exported area. You WILL want to use this because
		if you don't it might take Minecraft a literal minute to process load. Area commands look
		like this:
			-z 125:170
		Which will limit the exported area to Z-levels 125 through 170. Note that the game
		internally runs from 0 upward while the displayed numbers are from ground level, so scroll
		down to your lowest level and subtract that from the Z-height you want, ie if your bottom
		is -127 level 9 becomes 9 + 127 = 136. X and Y ranges start from the top left of the screen.
		Width of a fortress map is 48 tiles per unit of embark size, or 240x240 for a default 5x5
		embark.
		
		<filename> is where your file will be exported. This will be in the Dwarf Fortress base
		folder. DON'T give it the name of any files that are already there.
		
		Once you have exported once, you can press the up arrow key in the DFHack console to
		recall recent commands. At least on the Steam version, this works between sessions.
		
	3. Compress the file (I will work on automating this)
		WorldEdit likes its data files compressed. Locate the output file you made and compress it
		to gzip format. Change the file extension to .schem
		
	4. Place the compressed file in <your Minecraft install>\config\worldedit\schematics
	
	5. Open Minecraft world
		- Start the Minecraft launcher
		- Select Java Edition
		- At the top, select Installations
		- Hover over NeoForge and press Play
	
	6. Create a suitable world. You probably want:
		- Creative game mode
		- World Type: Superflat
		- Generate Structures: Off
	
	7. Load the exported world
		- Press the ?\ key to open the console
		- Enter //schem load <your file name>.schem
		- Enter //paste
		- Wait a very long time for Minecraft to stop freaking out
		- Enjoy playing with your new DF toy set
